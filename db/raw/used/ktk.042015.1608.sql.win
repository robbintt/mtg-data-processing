You can’t mix up the positions of your face-down permanents to disguise this. £9/20/2014 : Morph lets you cast a card face down by paying {3}, and lets you turn the face-down permanent face up any time you have priority by paying its morph cost. £9/20/2014 : The face-down spell has no mana cost and has a converted mana cost of 0. When you cast a face-down spell, put it on the stack face down so no other player knows what it is, and pay {3}. This is an alternative cost. £9/20/2014 : When the spell resolves, it enters the battlefield as a 2/2 creature with no name, mana cost, creature types, or abilities. It’s colorless and has a converted mana cost of 0. Other effects that apply to the creature can still grant it any of these characteristics. £9/20/2014 : Any time you have priority, you may turn the face-down creature face up by revealing what its morph cost is and paying that cost. This is a special action. It doesn’t use the stack and can’t be responded to. Only a face-down permanent can be turned face up this way; a face-down spell cannot. £9/20/2014 : Because the permanent is on the battlefield both before and after it’s turned face up, turning a permanent face up doesn’t cause any enters-the-battlefield abilities to trigger. £9/20/2014 : A permanent that turns face up or face down changes characteristics but is otherwise the same permanent. Spells and abilities that were targeting that permanent, as well as Auras and Equipment that were attached to the permanent, aren’t affected. £9/20/2014 : At any time, you can look at a face-down spell or permanent you control. You can’t look at face-down spells or permanents you don’t control unless an effect instructs you to do so. £9/20/2014 : You must ensure that your face-down spells and permanents can easily be differentiated from each other. You’re not allowed to mix up the cards that represent them on the battlefield in order to confuse other players. The order they entered the battlefield should remain clear. Common methods for doing this include using markers or dice, or simply placing them in order on the battlefield. £9/20/2014 : If a face-down permanent leaves the battlefield, you must reveal it.

When you cast a face-down spell, put it on the stack face down so no other player knows what it is, and pay {3}. This is an alternative cost. £9/20/2014 : When the spell resolves, it enters the battlefield as a 2/2 creature with no name, mana cost, creature types, or abilities. It’s colorless and has a converted mana cost of 0. Other effects that apply to the creature can still grant it any of these characteristics. £9/20/2014 : Any time you have priority, you may turn the face-down creature face up by revealing what its morph cost is and paying that cost. This is a special action. It doesn’t use the stack and can’t be responded to. Only a face-down permanent can be turned face up this way; a face-down spell cannot. £9/20/2014 : Because the permanent is on the battlefield both before and after it’s turned face up, turning a permanent face up doesn’t cause any enters-the-battlefield abilities to trigger. £9/20/2014 : A permanent that turns face up or face down changes characteristics but is otherwise the same permanent. Spells and abilities that were targeting that permanent, as well as Auras and Equipment that were attached to the permanent, aren’t affected. £9/20/2014 : At any time, you can look at a face-down spell or permanent you control. You can’t look at face-down spells or permanents you don’t control unless an effect instructs you to do so. £9/20/2014 : You must ensure that your face-down spells and permanents can easily be differentiated from each other. You’re not allowed to mix up the cards that represent them on the battlefield in order to confuse other players. The order they entered the battlefield should remain clear. Common methods for doing this include using markers or dice, or simply placing them in order on the battlefield. £9/20/2014 : If a face-down permanent leaves the battlefield, you must reveal it. You must also reveal all face-down spells and permanents you control if you leave the game or if the game ends.

If you don’t cast another instant or sorcery spell during that turn, both delayed triggered abilities will cease to exist. £9/20/2014 : The delayed triggered abilities will copy any instant or sorcery spell, not just one with targets. £9/20/2014 : When either ability resolves, it creates a copy of the instant or sorcery spell.

You may change any number of the targets, including all of them or none of them. If, for one of the targets, you can’t choose a new legal target, then it remains unchanged (even if the current target is illegal).

If any player responds to the ability, that player won’t yet know what card will be returned. £9/20/2014 : Because the ability doesn’t target any creature card, any creature card (including Kheru Lich Lord itself) put into the graveyard in response to that ability may be returned to the battlefield. £9/20/2014 : The ability that exiles the card at the beginning of your next end step is a delayed triggered ability. If the delayed triggered ability is countered, the creature will stay on the battlefield and the ability won’t trigger again. However, the replacement effect will still exile the creature when it eventually leaves the battlefield. £9/20/2014 : Kheru Lich Lord grants flying, trample, and haste to the creature that’s returned to the battlefield. However, neither of the “exile” abilities is granted to that creature. If that creature loses all its abilities, it will still be exiled at the beginning of your next end step, and if it would leave the battlefield, it is still exiled instead. £9/20/2014 : If a creature card returned to the battlefield with Kheru Lich Lord would leave the battlefield for any reason, it’s exiled instead. However, if that creature is already being exiled, then the replacement effect won’t apply. If the spell or ability that exiles it later returns it to the battlefield (as Suspension Field might, for example), the creature card will return to the battlefield as a new object with no relation to its previous existence.

You can pay additional costs, such as kicker costs. If the card has any mandatory additional costs, you must pay those. £9/20/2014 : If the card has {X} in its mana cost, you must choose 0 as the value for X when casting it. £9/20/2014 : Morph lets you cast a card face down by paying {3}, and lets you turn the face-down permanent face up any time you have priority by paying its morph cost. £9/20/2014 : The face-down spell has no mana cost and has a converted mana cost of 0. When you cast a face-down spell, put it on the stack face down so no other player knows what it is, and pay {3}. This is an alternative cost. £9/20/2014 : When the spell resolves, it enters the battlefield as a 2/2 creature with no name, mana cost, creature types, or abilities.

This is a special action. It doesn’t use the stack and can’t be responded to. Only a face-down permanent can be turned face up this way; a face-down spell cannot. £9/20/2014 : Because the permanent is on the battlefield both before and after it’s turned face up, turning a permanent face up doesn’t cause any enters-the-battlefield abilities to trigger. £9/20/2014 : A permanent that turns face up or face down changes characteristics but is otherwise the same permanent.

You can’t look at face-down spells or permanents you don’t control unless an effect instructs you to do so. £9/20/2014 : You must ensure that your face-down spells and permanents can easily be differentiated from each other. You’re not allowed to mix up the cards that represent them on the battlefield in order to confuse other players. The order they entered the battlefield should remain clear. Common methods for doing this include using markers or dice, or simply placing them in order on the battlefield. £9/20/2014 : If a face-down permanent leaves the battlefield, you must reveal it.

Spells and abilities that were targeting that permanent, as well as Auras and Equipment that were attached to the permanent, aren’t affected. £9/20/2014 : At any time, you can look at a face-down spell or permanent you control. You can’t look at face-down spells or permanents you don’t control unless an effect instructs you to do so. £9/20/2014 : You must ensure that your face-down spells and permanents can easily be differentiated from each other. You’re not allowed to mix up the cards that represent them on the battlefield in order to confuse other players. The order they entered the battlefield should remain clear. Common methods for doing this include using markers or dice, or simply placing them in order on the battlefield. £9/20/2014 : If a face-down permanent leaves the battlefield, you must reveal it.
